# Holistically_Attracted_Wireframe_Parsing

This project presents a fast and parsimonious parsing method to accurately and robustly detect a vectorized wireframe  in an input image with a single forward pass. The proposed method is end-to-end  trainable, consisting of three components: (i) line segment and junction proposal generation,(ii) line segment and junction matching, and (iii) line segment and junction verification. 
For computing line segment proposals, a novel exact  dual representation is proposed which exploits a parsimonious geometric reparameterization for line  segments and forms a holistic 4-dimensional attraction field map for an input image. Tech: Python,JupiterNotebook, numpy, HTML,CSS and javascript 
and deep-learning.
